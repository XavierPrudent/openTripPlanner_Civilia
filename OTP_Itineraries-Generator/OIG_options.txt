# It may be tempting to set this higher than walkReluctance (as studies often find this kind of preferences among
# riders) but the planner will take this literally and walk down a transit line to avoid waiting at a stop.
# This used to be set less than 1 (0.95) which would make waiting offboard preferable to waiting onboard in an
# interlined trip. That is also undesirable.

# If we only tried the shortest possible transfer at each stop to neighboring stop patterns, this problem could disappear.
